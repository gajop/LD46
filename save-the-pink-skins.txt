Idea: Planet Earth being bombarded by meteors/comets and aliens saving it with tractor beams
- Seems easy to make fun
- Seems easy to do art for
- Probably doable in a day with extra time for polish
- PICKED: I'm new to Rust/ggez and want to finish something.

Game:
- Name: Save the Pink Skins
- Description:
- Mandatory mechanics:
	- Core loop: Move around in your spaceship and save earth from meteors by dragging them away with a tractor beam
	- Meteors spawn continously and some of them go towards Earth. Different size & speed
	- Basic physics (gravity, speed, acceleration)
	- Tractor beam mechanics
- Optional mechanics:
	- Population (allow ocassional failure): Each meteor hit will cause a population hit depending on speed and size
	- Overpopulation is bad so kill the pink skins from time to time
	- Meteor collisions break the meteor
	- Atmosphere burn for small meteors
	- Multiple planets
- Controls: WASD to move. Mouse move to direct tractor beam, LMB to toggle activate
