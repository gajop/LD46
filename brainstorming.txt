Keep it alive, it's fragile
	- Something immobile that's being attacked
	- Idea: Planet Earth being bombarded by meteors/comets and aliens saving it with tractor beams
		- Seems easy to make fun
		- Seems easy to do art for
		- Probably doable in a day with extra time for polish
		- PICKED: I'm new to Rust/ggez and want to finish something.
	- Something weak and moving, easily killed by monsters or obstacles
Keep it alive, although you shouldn't
	- A comedic take
	- Idea: Keep the pest alive while farmers are trying to get rid of it
Keep the hive organism alive
	- Ants, bees, etc.
	- Perhaps interesting as an RTS or God-sim game :)
Keep the lemming(s) alive
	- Idea: Help a creature in a maze
		- Imagine a hamster :)
		- It moves through the maze in a predetermined way (arrows on floor?)
		- Make sure it doesn't go to dangerous locations by doing some actions, e.g. change some arrows (limited actions)
		- Easy to make fun
		- A bit of work to code & design different levels
		- Not that much work to do art
	- Idea: Lemmings copy
		- Well it's a copy.. so no
		- Also levels will probably be hard to make
Keep it alive while modifying what it does
	- Inspired by lemmings. How about we modify what the thing we're protecting does?
	- It's mostly autonomous but we can control it to a point, and what we do is impactful
Keep the ecosystem alive
	- Basically, Keep the balance alive
	- Idea: Balance the food chain
		- Dragging and dropping creatures around "potential" food?
		- Dragging near other similar species for reproduction?
		- Saving the few remaining ones?
		- Seems fun to implement, but hard to make fun. Also lots of creature drawing & animation which I'm bad at :)
		- PS: I'd like to make a proper environment sim one day and Rust seems like a good idea for that with all the "Data Driven" engines :)
Keep the movement alive
	- How would I make this into a game?
